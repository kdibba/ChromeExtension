# Research Link Saver

I created **Research Link Saver** as a simple Chrome extension to help me store links temporarily while doing research. Sometimes I’m going through multiple websites and just want to keep track of them during my session without worrying about organizing or bookmarking them permanently.  

> **Note:** The links are only stored for the current browsing session. Once I close Chrome, they’re gone.

---

## Features
- Add links to the extension with a click.
- View all my added links in one place.
- Perfect for quick, temporary research sessions.

---

## How I Use It
1. I open the extension from my Chrome toolbar.
2. I paste or type the link I want to save.
3. I click **Save** and the link is stored temporarily.
4. I can come back to the extension any time during my session to access the links I’ve added.

---

## Limitations
- Links disappear when I close Chrome or refresh the extension.
- There’s no local or cloud storage yet — this is meant for short-term use only.

---

## How to Install
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to:  
   `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select this extension’s folder.
5. The extension icon should now show up in your Chrome toolbar.

---

## What I Plan to Add Next
- Persistent storage so my links stay saved even after I close Chrome.
- The ability to export links to a file.
- Tagging and categorization for better organization.
